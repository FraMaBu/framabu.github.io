*Apr 2024 - Feb 2025*  
At Valcon, I served as a Senior Data Scientist and technical lead, driving the full lifecycle of ML/AI projects—from discovery through implementation—while operationalizing Agile and MLOps methodologies. Notably, I developed an AI recommendation system for invoicing at a multinational damage restoration company using autoencoders and large language models, generating over 1.5 million DKK in additional revenue and recouping 64% of project costs within six months.

### Senior Consultant — PwC Denmark
*Sep 2022 - Dec 2023*  
At PwC, I spearheaded data science initiatives in Tax and Legal services, engineering cutting-edge tax engines that automated financial data processing for multinational groups and significantly reduced reporting errors. I also implemented web-based document generation solutions on Google Cloud, cutting tax documentation drafting time by up to 80%, while serving as a Scrum Master to enhance cross-functional team performance.

### PhD Fellow — CBS
*Sep 2018 - Apr 2022*  
At CBS, I pursued a PhD in Operations Management focused on how environmental regulations drive technology adoption in the maritime industry’s green transition. My research combined advanced statistical techniques like quantile regression with rigorous mathematical modeling and Monte-Carlo simulations to chart green transition pathsways. I also trained Machine Learning models, such as Random Forests, to predict green fuel adoption, offering actionable insights for policy makers and industry practitioners.

### Research Associate — CBS PRME
*May 2017 - Jun 2018*  
At CBS PRME, I conducted extensive empirical research in responsible management education by designing surveys, collecting robust data, and applying advanced statistical inference with panel models like Fixed-Effects. My work yielded critical insights that directly informed curriculum design and enhanced teaching strategies for undergraduate students.

## Consulting Projects

### Evidence-based Priority Setting for World Bank Healthcare Financing
*Jan 2024 - Apr 2024*  
At Results for Development (R4D), I led a comparative analysis to support the World Bank in refining health financing priorities across low- and middle-income countries. I designed and implemented a hybrid approach leveraging LLMs and advanced NLP techniques to conduct a structured analysis of 75 health project documents, generating a unique qualitative dataset. This innovative analysis produced actionable, testable hypotheses that are now shaping enhanced health financing strategies across twelve LMICs.
