## Overview

This project is drawn from my consulting experience where I served as the lead for the technical team. In this case study, I detail how advanced AI techniques were deployed to solve real-world invoicing challenges, transforming a manual and error-prone process into one that is both efficient and highly accurate.

## The challenge

Invoicing is a crucial process in any business. Even minor inaccuracies can disrupt cash flow and lead to lost revenue. A client in the damage recovery sector—working closely with insurance companies to repair properties after incidents such as fires, floods, and storms—faced a challenges in their traditional invoicing process.

Key details were often overlooked, and manually matching cost lines on ledgers and invoices was both time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, the company managed a range of unique invoicing agreements, with some customers billed by the hour, others by the unit, and still others on a flat-rate basis. This inconsistency made it difficult to detect missing invoice lines, directly impacting revenue.

## The innovative solution

To address these challenges, we developed a machine learning system built on a modular neural network architecture. The AI solution automates invoice validation by identifying missing details—streamlining a process that was previously a significant bottleneck. A central component of this system is the use of autoencoders, a type of neural network that compresses and translates diverse data formats.

In this application, the autoencoder serves as a “translator,” standardizing the various invoicing agreements into a common format. This approach enabled the use of transfer learning, where insights from one dataset are applied to solve similar challenges across different contexts, significantly enhancing the system’s accuracy and adaptability.

## Impact & benefits

The benefits of this AI-driven solution were substantial:

- **Increased accuracy:** Automated invoice reviews now flag missing details, reducing manual errors while keeping financial experts in the loop.
- **Revenue growth:** By ensuring that all cost lines are correctly captured, the improved process boosted revenue by approximately 3%.
- **Enhanced efficiency:** What once took up to three weeks now often only takes seconds—drastically reducing processing times and accelerating payments.
- **Exceptional ROI:** The system generates four times its operational costs in revenue each month, clearly demonstrating its financial feasability.

This case study exemplifies how advanced data science techniques—such as modular neural networks and transfer learning—can transform traditional business processes, driving both operational excellence and significant financial benefits.
