We were tasked by an electrity provider to address the challenges of accurately forecasting household power consumption—a critical component for efficient energy management and grid stability. The provider faced the common industry dilemma of traditional forecasting models that struggled to capture the complex, cyclical nature of energy usage, often resulting in resource misallocation and increased operational costs.

## The challenge

Forecasting household power consumption is inherently difficult due to the presence of daily, weekly, and even annual cycles that influence energy usage. Conventional methods, such as linear regression or standard LSTM networks, often struggle with identifying these recurring signals among the general noise of power consumption data. This led to forecasts that significantly deviated from actual consumption, especially during peak hours. For the client, inaccurate predictions meant that resource planning and grid management were less efficient, with direct implications on operational costs and service reliability.

## The innovative solution

To overcome these limitations, we developed a hybrid forecasting architetucture. This approach combined the strength of deep learning with the explicit mathematical modeling of known periodic cycles. Our solution integrated two branches: one that processed raw sequential energy data using an LSTM network, and another that incorporated deterministic Fourier features to capture the inherent cyclical patterns of power consumption. By merging these insights, the model was able to deliver more precise predictions, turning complex energy usage data into explainable business insights.

For those interested in the underlying methodology, a detailed [technical report](https://github.com/FraMaBu/forecast-power-consumption/blob/main/README.md) outlines the model’s general architecture, specifics about the example dataset, and experimental results. Additionally, the [GitHub project](https://github.com/FraMaBu/forecast-power-consumption) exemplifies how the approach can be implemented and benchmarked against other forecasting approaches in a reproducable manner.

## Impact & Benefits
The hybrid forecasting approach yielded significant benefits:
- **Improved forecast accuracy:** The Hybrid model achieved an 8% reduction in forecasting errors compared to traditional approaches.
- **Cost efficiency:** Enhanced accuracy allowed the electricity provider to better match supply with demand, resulting in lower operational costs.
- **Optimized resource allocation:** More precise forecasts led to smarter grid management and proactive planning for peak and off-peak periods.

This case study outlines a high-level approach to transforming energy forecasting through advanced machine learning techniques. By incorporating domain-specific knowledge into our Hybrid LSTM-Fourier model, we delivered a solution that not only improved prediction accuracy but also translated into tangible business benefits for an electricity provider. This underscores how tailored, innovative forecasting methodologies can drive significant operational efficiencies and cost savings in the energy sector.
